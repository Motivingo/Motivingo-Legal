  <h1>Terms of Service (Motivingo)</h1>
  <p class="muted">Effective Date: 25 January 2026</p>

  <p>These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of Motivingo (the “App”), operated by the developer (“we,” “us,” or “our”). By downloading, installing, accessing, or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the App.</p>

  <h2>1. WHO WE ARE</h2>
  <p>Motivingo is developed and provided by an independent developer.</p>
  <p>We do not currently operate a dedicated website for the App. If you need support, wish to submit a legal notice, or have questions about these Terms, please contact us through the App.</p>

  <h2>2. ELIGIBILITY</h2>
  <p>You must be at least 13 years old (or the minimum age required in your country) to use the App. If you are under the age of majority in your jurisdiction, you may only use the App with the consent and supervision of a parent or legal guardian.</p>

  <h2>3. LICENSE AND ACCEPTABLE USE</h2>
  <p><strong>3.1 License</strong><br>
  We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the App for your personal, non-commercial use, subject to these Terms and applicable law.</p>

  <p><strong>3.2 Acceptable Use</strong><br>
  You agree not to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>use the App in any unlawful, harmful, or fraudulent manner;</li>
    <li>attempt to reverse engineer, decompile, decode, or otherwise derive source code from the App, except where such restriction is prohibited by law;</li>
    <li>interfere with or disrupt the App, its security, or its servers;</li>
    <li>circumvent or attempt to circumvent access controls, paywalls, subscription checks, or entitlement validation;</li>
    <li>use the App to harass, threaten, or abuse others.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. CORE FUNCTIONALITY DISCLAIMER (FOCUS / BLOCKING FEATURES)</h2>
  <p>Motivingo may offer “focus,” “blocking,” or “distraction reduction” features using Apple-provided frameworks and device capabilities (for example, Screen Time / FamilyControls where available).</p>
  <p>Important notes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Effectiveness depends on iOS behavior, device settings, granted permissions, and Apple platform limitations.</li>
    <li>We do not guarantee that all selected apps, websites, or distractions will always be blocked in every scenario (e.g., system restrictions, emergency functions, OS changes, or API limitations).</li>
    <li>You are responsible for enabling and maintaining required permissions and settings.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. POINTS, REWARDS, AND GAMIFICATION</h2>
  <p>The App may provide points, streaks, badges, levels, or rewards for motivational purposes.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Points and rewards have no cash value and are not redeemable for real currency.</li>
    <li>We may modify point calculations, reward “prices,” availability, or rules to improve balance, prevent abuse, or reflect product changes.</li>
    <li>We may remove or change rewards (including premium rewards) for policy, technical, or safety reasons.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. SUBSCRIPTIONS, TRIALS, AND IN-APP PURCHASES</h2>
  <p>Motivingo may offer paid features through Apple In-App Purchases (“IAP”), including subscriptions (e.g., monthly/yearly) and/or one-time purchases (e.g., lifetime access), if enabled.</p>

  <p><strong>6.1 Billing and Renewal</strong><br>
  - Payments are processed by Apple, not by us.<br>
  - Subscriptions renew automatically unless canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.<br>
  - Your Apple ID account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period, at the price displayed in the App Store at the time of renewal.</p>

  <p><strong>6.2 Managing and Canceling Subscriptions</strong><br>
  You can manage or cancel subscriptions in your Apple ID account settings:<br>
  Settings → Apple ID → Subscriptions.</p>

  <p><strong>6.3 Trials (if offered)</strong><br>
  If a free trial is offered, it will convert to a paid subscription unless canceled before the trial ends. Trial terms (duration and price after trial) are shown at the time you start the trial.</p>

  <p><strong>6.4 Refunds</strong><br>
  Refund requests are handled by Apple under Apple’s policies. We cannot issue refunds directly for App Store purchases.</p>

  <h2>7. APPLE TERMS</h2>
  <p>Your use of the App is also subject to Apple’s applicable terms and policies, including the Apple Media Services Terms and Conditions and any Apple end user license agreement that applies in your region. If these Terms conflict with Apple’s mandatory terms, Apple’s terms may control where required.</p>

  <h2>8. USER CONTENT AND DATA YOU PROVIDE</h2>
  <p>You may enter information into the App (for example: tasks, study sessions, categories, custom rewards).</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You are responsible for the accuracy and legality of the information you provide.</li>
    <li>You must not enter content that is unlawful, harassing, or infringes someone else’s rights.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>9. PRIVACY</h2>
  <p>We respect your privacy. Motivingo may process certain data to provide and improve the App (for example: app settings, usage events, or purchase entitlement status).</p>
  <p>If the App displays a separate in-app Privacy Policy screen, that policy forms part of your agreement with us.</p>

  <h2>10. AVAILABILITY, CHANGES, AND UPDATES</h2>
  <p>We may change, suspend, or discontinue the App or any feature at any time, including premium features, to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>improve performance or user experience,</li>
    <li>comply with legal or platform requirements,</li>
    <li>prevent abuse or security issues.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We may release updates that you must install to continue using the App.</p>

  <h2>11. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES</h2>
  <p>THE APP IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE.” To the maximum extent permitted by law, we disclaim all warranties, express or implied, including implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.</p>
  <p>We do not guarantee that the App will be uninterrupted, error-free, or fully effective for your intended outcomes (e.g., improved grades, productivity, or reduced screen time).</p>

  <h2>12. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h2>
  <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>We will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits, data, goodwill, or other intangible losses arising from your use of (or inability to use) the App.</li>
    <li>Our total liability for any claim arising out of or relating to the App will not exceed the amount you paid (if any) to use the App in the 12 months before the event giving rise to the claim, or EUR 0.00 if you paid nothing.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow certain limitations; in that case, these limits apply only to the extent permitted.</p>

  <h2>13. INDEMNITY</h2>
  <p>You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from any claims, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising from:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>your misuse of the App,</li>
    <li>your violation of these Terms,</li>
    <li>your violation of any law or third-party rights.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>14. TERMINATION</h2>
  <p>We may suspend or terminate your access to the App if you materially breach these Terms or if required for legal, security, or safety reasons. You may stop using the App at any time by uninstalling it.</p>
  <p>Sections that by their nature should survive termination (including liability limits, disclaimers, and governing law) will remain in effect.</p>

  <h2>15. GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION</h2>
  <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the Netherlands, excluding conflict-of-law rules. If you are a consumer in the EU, you may also benefit from mandatory consumer protections of your country of residence. Disputes will be submitted to the competent courts in the Netherlands, unless mandatory consumer law provides otherwise.</p>

  <h2>16. CHANGES TO THESE TERMS</h2>
  <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. If we make material changes, we will take reasonable steps to inform you within the App. Continued use of the App after the effective date of updated Terms means you accept the updated Terms.</p>

  <h2>17. CONTACT</h2>
  <p>Questions about these Terms or the App: contact us through the App.</p>
